# SDS291: Multiple Regression Project

## Title: The Influence of Parenthood and Age on Adults Pursuing Higher Education

The purpose of our analysis is to explore factors that influence the likelihood of an adult pursuing higher education. Using data from the National Surveys of College Graduates (NSCG), Recent College Graduates (NSRCG), and Doctorate Recipients (SDR) available in the IPUMS database, we explore the likelihood of an adult to pursue higher education is based on the number of children the adult has, as well as their age. We will compare three different logistic regression models with enrolled/graduated higher education in the last five years as the response variable. Through our research, we have concluded that a person's age and the number of children are significant enough to contribute to predicting the chances of an adult pursuing higher education.
